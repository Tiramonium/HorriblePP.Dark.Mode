# HorriblePP Dark Mode
Changes the color scheme and default background colors to darker variations of the HorriblePP website

## How to make it all work
If you haven't done this kind of thing before, the first thing you'll want is either a webkit based browser,
like Chrome/Chromium/Canary/Nightly, Opera GX, Chromium Edge, Safari, or a latest version Mozilla Firefox, regardless of your Operating System.

1. Add the Stylus Extension

    - On [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us)
    - On [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)
    - If you're on a different webkit browser

        - First you'll have to set up your browser to be able to install extensions from other stores,
        since those two are the only versions/extensions that are actually stable and work as far as I have seen.
        - After that, visit the Chrome store link and install the extension.

2. Install the Style

    - Visit [UserStyles](https://userstyles.org/styles/216576/horriblepp-dark-mode?utm_campaign=stylish_stylepage)
    - Click on "Install Style"
    - If everything works, you should see the style being updated in real time while visiting HPP

## PS #1

UserStyles recommends using the Stylish extension, but I recommend using Stylus instead,
which doesn't offer to constantly monitor the user's browsing history to suggest the user new styles,
has no Terms of Service or EULA to be agreed to and simply manages the chosen styles installation.

## PS #2

I also recommend installing it from there instead of directly importing from here on GitHub
because the site detects when the user is running a previous version of the style and shows an option
to update the style instead of having to remove the installed style and import it from scratch.
It's just more convenient that way.
