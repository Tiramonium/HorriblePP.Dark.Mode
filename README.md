# HorriblePP Dark Mode
Changes the color scheme and default background colors to darker variations of the HorriblePP website

## How to make it all work
If you haven't done this kind of thing before, the first thing you'll want is either a webkit based browser,
like Chrome/Chromium/Canary/Nightly, Opera GX, Chromium Edge, Safari, or a latest version Mozilla Firefox, regardless of your Operating System.

## Add an style extension
UserStyles recommends using the Stylish extension, but I recommend using Stylus instead,
which doesn't offer to constantly monitor the user's browsing history to suggest the user new styles,
has no Terms of Service or EULA to be agreed to and simply manages the chosen styles installation.

1. Install Stylus

    - On [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us)
    - On [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)
    - If you're on a different webkit browser

        - First you'll have to set up your browser to be able to install extensions from other stores,
        since those two are the only versions/extensions that are actually stable and work as far as I have seen
        - After that, visit the Chrome [store link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) and install the extension

## Installing the style
I recommend installing from UserStyles because the Stylus extension detects when there is an update for the style and offers to update it automatically.

1. Install from UserStyles

    - Visit the [UserStyles](https://userstyles.org/styles/216576/horriblepp-dark-mode?utm_campaign=stylish_stylepage) page
    - Click on "Install Style"
    - If everything works, you should see the style being updated in real time while visiting HPP

However, it seems like as usual, UserStyles can't be trusted at all times,
so in case it chooses to act up and stop working as it was supposed to, you should install manually.

1. Uninstall the style first if you had it previously installed

    - Click on Stylus' icon. It can be hidden below the extensions icon on Chrome if it is unpinned
    - Click on "Manage Installed Styles"
    - Click on the 'X' icon on the right of the theme's name and confirm its deletion

2. Install from GitHub

    - Click on "Code" and "Download zip" or clone the project if you know how
    - On Stylus "Manage Installed Styles" page, on the "Actions" section on the left navbar, click on "Write New Style"
    - Click on "Import" and find the file you downloaded or cloned
    - Name it "HorriblePP Dark Mode" and Save
